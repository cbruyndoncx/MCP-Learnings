## Blog 6: Local Channels - The Stdio Transport in .NET and Java MCP

**Series:** Deep Dive into the Model Context Protocol SDKs (C# & Java)
**Post:** 6 of 10

Welcome back! In our exploration of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDKs for C# and Java, we've covered the [protocol's definition](blog-2.md), the [high-level](blog-3.md) and [low-level](blog-4.md) server APIs, and the [client architecture](blog-5.md). Today, we shift focus to the communication pathways themselves â€“ the **Transports**.

Transports are the fundamental mechanism for exchanging MCP messages (requests, responses, notifications) between a client and a server. They abstract the underlying communication channel, whether it's network sockets, HTTP streams, or, as we'll explore today, the standard streams of a local process.

This post dives into the **Stdio (Standard Input/Output)** transport, a crucial component for enabling local interactions in both the C# and Java SDKs.

### What is Stdio Transport?

Imagine you have a powerful command-line tool, a script, or even a full desktop application written in C# or Java that you want an AI assistant (the MCP client) to interact with. You don't want to expose this tool over the network for security or simplicity reasons. This is where Stdio shines.

The Stdio transport facilitates communication between two processes running on the *same machine*:

1.  **The Client:** Launches the MCP server application as a child process.
2.  **The Server:** Runs as this child process.
3.  **Communication:**
    *   The client sends JSON-RPC messages (encoded as newline-delimited JSON strings) to the server process's **standard input (`stdin`)**.
    *   The server sends its JSON-RPC messages (responses, notifications) to its **standard output (`stdout`)**.
    *   The client reads these messages from the server's `stdout`.
    *   The server's **standard error (`stderr`)** is typically captured or redirected by the client for logging and debugging.

This creates a secure, local, and direct communication channel without requiring network ports or complex setup.

### C# SDK: Leveraging `.NET` Processes and Hosting

The C# SDK provides idiomatic implementations using standard .NET process and stream APIs, integrating well with the `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` model.

**Key Components:**

1.  **`StdioClientTransport` (`src/.../Transport/StdioClientTransport.cs`):**
    *   Responsible for launching and managing the server process.
    *   Takes `StdioClientTransportOptions` (command, arguments, environment variables, working directory, shutdown timeout).
    *   Uses `System.Diagnostics.Process` to start the server (`Process.Start`).
    *   Configures `ProcessStartInfo` to redirect `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr`.
    *   Internally creates an `StdioClientSessionTransport` (which implements `ITransport`) to handle the actual stream communication once the process starts.
    *   Crucially uses `ProcessHelper.KillTree` (`src/.../Utils/ProcessHelper.cs`) upon disposal to ensure the server process *and any child processes it spawned* are terminated cleanly, especially important on Windows.

2.  **`StdioClientSessionTransport` (Internal - `src/.../Transport/StdioClientSessionTransport.cs`):**
    *   The `ITransport` implementation used by the client *after* the process is started.
    *   Inherits from `StreamClientSessionTransport`, using `TextWriter` (for `stdin`) and `TextReader` (for `stdout`) wrappers around the process streams.
    *   Handles the line-delimited JSON framing.

3.  **`StdioServerTransport` (`src/.../Transport/StdioServerTransport.cs`):**
    *   The `ITransport` implementation used by a server *launched via Stdio*.
    *   Assumes it's running as the child process.
    *   Inherits from `StreamServerTransport`.
    *   Wraps `Console.OpenStandardInput()` and `Console.OpenStandardOutput()` (using a special `CancellableStdinStream` for better cancellation handling).
    *   Reads line-delimited JSON from `stdin` and writes it to `stdout`.

4.  **Integration (`WithStdioServerTransport`):**
    *   The `IMcpServerBuilder.WithStdioServerTransport()` extension method registers `StdioServerTransport` as the `ITransport` implementation in the DI container.
    *   It also registers `SingleSessionMcpServerHostedService`, an `IHostedService` that retrieves the `IMcpServer` and `ITransport` from DI and runs the server's message processing loop when the host starts. This service ensures the server exits when `stdin` closes.

**Example Flow (Client Starting Server):**

```csharp
// C# Client launching a Stdio Server
using ModelContextProtocol.Client;
using ModelContextProtocol.Protocol.Transport;

var options = new StdioClientTransportOptions {
    Command = "dotnet", // Command to run the server
    Arguments = ["MyMcpServer.dll"], // Arguments for the command
    Name = "MyLocalServer"
};

// 1. Create the client transport - defines how to launch the server
IClientTransport clientTransport = new StdioClientTransport(options);

// 2. Create the client - this connects and initializes
// McpClientFactory internally calls clientTransport.ConnectAsync(),
// which starts the process and returns an ITransport (StdioClientSessionTransport)
await using IMcpClient client = await McpClientFactory.CreateAsync(clientTransport);

// 3. Interact with the server
var tools = await client.ListToolsAsync();
Console.WriteLine($"Server Tools: {string.Join(", ", tools.Select(t => t.Name))}");

// 4. Disposing the client will dispose the transport, which terminates the process
```

### Java SDK: ProcessBuilder and Explicit Session Management

The Java SDK uses standard `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` and relies on the server-side `McpServerTransportProvider` pattern.

**Key Components:**

1.  **`StdioClientTransport` (`mcp/src/.../client/transport/StdioClientTransport.java`):**
    *   Implements `McpClientTransport`.
    *   Takes `ServerParameters` (command, args, env).
    *   Uses `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` to configure and start the server process (`processBuilder.start()`).
    *   Its `connect` method returns a `Mono<Void>` and sets up internal threads/schedulers (`inboundScheduler`, `outboundScheduler`, `errorScheduler`) using `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()` and Reactor `Schedulers.fromExecutorService`.
    *   These schedulers manage dedicated threads for reading `stdout`, writing to `stdin`, and reading `stderr`, handling the blocking nature of Java's stream I/O.
    *   Uses `BufferedReader` and direct `OutputStream.write` for message framing.

2.  **`StdioServerTransportProvider` (`mcp/src/.../server/transport/StdioServerTransportProvider.java`):**
    *   Implements `McpServerTransportProvider`.
    *   Designed for servers *launched via Stdio*.
    *   Reads from `System.in` and writes to `System.out`.
    *   Crucially, it's designed for a **single session**. When `setSessionFactory` is called by the `McpServer`, it immediately creates *one* `McpServerSession` using an internal `StdioMcpSessionTransport`.
    *   It doesn't "accept" connections like network providers; it assumes the connection exists via the process's standard streams.

3.  **`StdioMcpSessionTransport` (Internal to Provider):**
    *   The `McpServerTransport` created by the provider.
    *   Manages writing outgoing messages to `System.out`. Receiving is handled by the provider reading `System.in` and pushing messages *into* the session via the `McpServerSession.handle` method (which is a bit different from the `ITransport.MessageReader` channel model in C#).

**Example Flow (Client Starting Server):**

```java
// Java Client launching a Stdio Server
import io.modelcontextprotocol.client.McpClient;
import io.modelcontextprotocol.client.McpSyncClient; // Using Sync for simplicity
import io.modelcontextprotocol.client.transport.ServerParameters;
import io.modelcontextprotocol.client.transport.StdioClientTransport;
import io.modelcontextprotocol.spec.McpClientTransport;
import io.modelcontextprotocol.spec.McpSchema.*;

// 1. Define Server Parameters
ServerParameters serverParams = ServerParameters.builder("java")
    .args("-jar", "my-mcp-server.jar")
    .build();

// 2. Create the client transport
McpClientTransport transport = new StdioClientTransport(serverParams);

// 3. Build the client
// The connect() method is called internally by the builder/client constructor
McpSyncClient client = McpClient.sync(transport)
    .requestTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(10))
    .build();

try {
    // 4. Explicitly Initialize
    client.initialize();
    System.out.println("Connected!");

    // 5. Interact
    ListToolsResult tools = client.listTools();
    System.out.println("Server Tools: " + tools.tools().stream()
            .map(Tool::name).collect(Collectors.joining(", ")));

} finally {
    // 6. Close the client (which closes the transport and terminates the process)
    client.closeGracefully();
}
```

### Comparison: Stdio Transports

| Feature            | C# SDK                                  | Java SDK                                      | Notes                                                                                   |
| :----------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Process API**    | `System.Diagnostics.Process`            | `java.lang.ProcessBuilder` / `Process`        | Standard APIs for each platform.                                                        |
| **Async IO**       | `.NET` Async Streams (`TextReader`/`Writer`) | Manual Threads/Schedulers + Blocking IO     | C# leverages built-in async stream capabilities. Java uses Reactor/Schedulers for background IO. |
| **Server Model**   | `StdioServerTransport` (implements `ITransport`) | `StdioServerTransportProvider` (creates Session) | C# treats Stdio server as a standard transport. Java uses the Provider pattern for servers. |
| **Session Handling** | Single session via `IHostedService`   | Single session created by Provider          | Both are fundamentally single-session on the server-side for Stdio.                   |
| **Shutdown**       | `ProcessHelper.KillTree` (robust)     | `Process.destroy()` / `onExit()` (standard) | C# includes specific logic to kill the entire process tree.                             |
| **Configuration**  | `StdioClientTransportOptions` (Client)  | `ServerParameters` (Client)                 | Similar configuration options.                                                          |

### End-User Nuance: Secure Local Power

The Stdio transport is the unsung hero enabling powerful, *secure* local AI integrations. Because it doesn't involve network sockets, it's inherently more secure for accessing local user data or executing local commands.

*   **File Access:** An AI assistant connected via Stdio to a server running in the context of an IDE or text editor can read the *actual* content of the user's open file (exposed as a `file://` Resource) without the file ever leaving the local machine.
*   **Local Automation:** A tool like "run current script" can be safely exposed via Stdio, allowing the AI to execute code locally *as the user*, respecting their permissions, without needing complex sandboxing or remote execution.
*   **System Information:** Tools providing local system stats (CPU, memory, running processes) can be offered securely.
*   **Offline Functionality:** Stdio-based tools work even when the user is offline.
*   **Simplified Deployment:** For tools meant only for local use (like the Claude Desktop plugin model implicitly supported by the Python SDK's CLI), Stdio avoids needing to package a web server or manage ports.

### Conclusion

The Stdio transport is a cornerstone of MCP for local application integration in both the .NET and Java ecosystems. While the implementation details differ â€“ C# leans on modern async streams and DI/Hosting, while Java uses `ProcessBuilder` with dedicated threads managed via Reactor Schedulers and a Transport Provider pattern â€“ both SDKs provide robust mechanisms for launching and communicating with local MCP servers.

This transport enables a class of secure, powerful integrations that leverage local context and capabilities, bridging the gap between general-purpose AI models and the specific tasks users perform on their own machines.

Next up, we'll contrast the web-based communication strategies, focusing on Java's HTTP+SSE approach and C#'s integration with ASP.NET Core (likely using Streamable HTTP) in **Blog 7: Web Transports**.
