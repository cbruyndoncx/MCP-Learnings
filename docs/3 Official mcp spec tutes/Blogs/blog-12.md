## Blog 12: Extending MCP - Custom Transports, Capabilities, and SDK Modifications

**Series:** Deep Dive into the Model Context Protocol SDKs (Advanced Topics)
**Post:** 12 of 12

In this series, we've thoroughly explored the standard features and architectures of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) SDKs for TypeScript, Python, C#, and Java. We've seen how they provide idiomatic ways to implement Tools, Resources, Prompts, and handle communication over standard transports like Stdio and HTTP variants.

However, advanced use cases sometimes demand capabilities beyond the core specification or require integration with non-standard communication channels. For developers hitting the limits of the out-of-the-box features, understanding the **extensibility points** and **customization strategies** within the SDKs is crucial.

This post delves into advanced techniques for extending and modifying MCP implementations, targeting developers who need to:

1.  Implement **Custom Transports** for specialized communication needs (e.g., gRPC, MQTT, named pipes).
2.  Define and handle **Custom Capabilities and Methods** beyond the standard MCP set.
3.  Modify core **SDK Behavior** (use with caution!).
4.  Customize **JSON Serialization** for specific data types or performance needs.
5.  Tune **Transport Performance**.

### 1. Why Extend or Customize?

While sticking to the standard MCP specification ensures maximum interoperability, customization might be necessary for:

*   **Proprietary Communication:** Integrating MCP over existing internal message queues or RPC mechanisms (MQTT, gRPC, ZeroMQ).
*   **Specialized Hardware/Protocols:** Interfacing with devices or systems that don't use standard TCP/IP or stdio (e.g., embedded systems, specific bus protocols).
*   **Experimental Features:** Prototyping new MCP capabilities or methods before proposing them for standardization.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Implementing highly optimized transports or serialization for specific high-throughput scenarios.
*   **Deep Framework Integration:** Embedding MCP communication logic more deeply within a specific application framework than the standard integrations allow.

**The Caveat:** Customizations, especially non-standard methods or transports, inherently limit interoperability. They are best suited for closed ecosystems or as precursors to standardization proposals.

### 2. Implementing Custom Transports

The core requirement is to bridge your custom communication channel with the SDK's expectation of sending and receiving `JsonRpcMessage` objects.

*   **The Contract:** Provide an implementation that can asynchronously:
    *   Establish and tear down the underlying connection.
    *   Serialize outgoing `JsonRpcMessage` objects into the transport's wire format (likely newline-delimited JSON for simplicity, but could be binary like Protobuf if paired with custom serialization) and send them.
    *   Receive raw data from the transport, frame it correctly (e.g., read until newline, decode packet), deserialize it into a `JsonRpcMessage`, and deliver it to the SDK's core session logic.
    *   Handle transport-level errors and connection closure events.
*   **SDK Approaches:**
    *   **TypeScript:** Implement the `Transport` interface (`start`, `send`, `close`, `onmessage`, `onclose`, `onerror`). Integrate with Node.js APIs (`net.Socket`, `dgram`, custom native modules) or Web APIs. Pass the custom transport instance to `client.connect` / `server.connect`.
    *   **Python:** Implement the transport factory pattern: an `asynccontextmanager` that yields two `anyio.streams.memory.MemoryObjectReceiveStream` / `MemoryObjectSendStream` pairs. Internally, start `anyio` tasks to read from your custom channel (e.g., `mqtt` client library, `grpc` stream) and push deserialized `JsonRpcMessage`s into the `read_stream_writer`, and another task to read from the `write_stream_reader`, serialize, and send over your custom channel. Integrate by passing the streams from your context manager to `ClientSession` / `Server.run`.
    *   **C#:** Implement `ITransport` (for sessions) and optionally `IClientTransport` (for connection). Manage underlying connection (e.g., `System.IO.Pipes`, `System.Net.Sockets`, gRPC client/server streams). Use `System.Threading.Channels` for the `MessageReader` property. Implement `SendMessageAsync` and `DisposeAsync`. Integrate via DI or direct instantiation with `McpServerFactory`/`McpClientFactory`.
    *   **Java:** Implement `McpTransport`, `McpClientTransport`, and potentially `McpServerTransportProvider`. Handle connection lifecycle. Use `ObjectMapper` (Jackson) for serialization. Use concurrent queues (`BlockingQueue`) or reactive streams (`FluxSink`/`MonoProcessor` from Reactor) to bridge between your I/O thread/callbacks and the `McpSession`. Integrate via the `McpClient.sync/async` or `McpServer.sync/async` builders.

**Example Idea (Conceptual WebSocket Server Transport - TS):**

```typescript
// Conceptual - Does NOT fully handle errors, lifecycle, etc.
import WebSocket, { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';
import { Transport, JSONRPCMessage, serializeMessage, deserializeMessage } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/shared'; // Assuming serialize/deserialize helpers exist

class WebSocketServerTransport implements Transport {
  private wss: WebSocketServer;
  private clients = new Set<WebSocket>();
  public onmessage?: (message: JSONRPCMessage) => void;
  public onclose?: () => void; // Note: Needs logic for *which* client closed
  public onerror?: (error: Error) => void;

  constructor(port: number) {
    this.wss = new WebSocketServer({ port });
  }

  async start(): Promise<void> {
    this.wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
      this.clients.add(ws);
      console.log('MCP Client connected via WebSocket');

      ws.on('message', (data) => {
        try {
          const message = deserializeMessage(data.toString()); // Assumes newline framing or similar
          this.onmessage?.(message);
        } catch (e) {
          this.onerror?.(e instanceof Error ? e : new Error(String(e)));
        }
      });

      ws.on('close', () => {
        this.clients.delete(ws);
        console.log('MCP Client disconnected');
        // Potentially trigger onclose if *all* clients disconnect? Needs session mapping.
      });

      ws.on('error', (err) => this.onerror?.(err));
    });
    console.log(`WebSocket MCP Server listening on port ${this.wss.options.port}`);
  }

  // Send needs targeting - MCP session usually 1:1 with transport
  // This simple broadcast isn't correct for standard MCP server logic
  // A real implementation needs session mapping.
  async send(message: JSONRPCMessage): Promise<void> {
    const serialized = serializeMessage(message);
    this.clients.forEach(client => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(serialized);
      }
    });
  }

  async close(): Promise<void> {
    this.wss.close();
    this.clients.clear();
    this.onclose?.();
  }
}
```
*(This example highlights the complexity - a real server needs to map incoming WS connections to individual MCP sessions and transports).*

### 3. Custom Capabilities and Methods

MCP is extensible through the `experimental` capabilities field and by allowing arbitrary method strings.

*   **Declaring:** Add custom keys to the `ClientCapabilities.experimental` or `ServerCapabilities.experimental` object during the `initialize` handshake.
*   **Handling Custom Requests/Notifications:**
    *   Use the **low-level** server APIs. The high-level APIs (`McpServer`/`FastMCP`) are typically focused on standard primitives.
        *   *TS:* `server.setRequestHandler("my_company/my_custom_request", myHandler)`
        *   *Python (Low-level):* `@server.request_handler("my_company/my_custom_request")`
        *   *C#:* Add to `McpServerOptions.Capabilities` handlers manually or create a custom `IMcpServerBuilder` extension. Handler receives `RequestContext<JsonNode?>`.
        *   *Java:* Add handler `BiFunction` to the map passed in `McpServerFeatures`. Handler receives `Exchange` and `Map<String, Object>`.
    *   Define custom POCO/POJO/Record/Interface types for your parameters and results and handle their JSON serialization/deserialization.
*   **Invoking Custom Requests/Notifications (Client):**
    *   Use the low-level `client.request(...)` or `client.notification(...)` methods (available in all SDKs), providing the custom method string.
    *   Manually serialize parameters and deserialize results using your custom types and the platform's JSON library.

**Warning:** Custom methods break interoperability unless the peer explicitly supports them. Use standard methods where possible or prefix custom methods clearly (e.g., `vendor_prefix/method_name`).

### 4. Modifying Core SDK Behavior

Altering the SDK's internal workings is risky and can lead to compatibility issues, but might be considered for deep integration or specialized needs.

*   **Inheritance:** Subclass core components (e.g., `McpSession`, `McpServer`, `StdioClientTransport`). Override methods to change behavior. **Risk:** Relies on internal APIs which may change between SDK versions. Test thoroughly.
*   **Dependency Injection (C#):** Replace default service implementations. For example, register a custom `IMcpServer` implementation or use a library like Scrutor to decorate existing services. Powerful but requires understanding the DI registrations.
*   **Composition/Wrapping:** Wrap existing SDK clients or servers in your own classes, intercepting calls to add custom logic before/after delegating to the inner instance (e.g., `DelegatingMcpServerTool` in C#). Safer than inheritance.
*   **Monkey Patching (Python/TS):** Discouraged. Replacing methods at runtime is fragile and breaks easily with SDK updates.
*   **Forking:** Last resort. You gain full control but lose upstream updates and bug fixes.
*   **Contribution:** The best approach for generally useful changes is to contribute them back to the official SDK repositories.

### 5. Customizing JSON Serialization

Needed for handling domain-specific types or optimizing performance.

*   **C# (`System.Text.Json`):** Provide custom `JsonSerializerOptions` (potentially with custom `JsonConverter`s registered) to `McpServerToolCreateOptions`, `McpServerPromptCreateOptions`, or configure globally via DI (`services.Configure<JsonOptions>(...)`). Leverage `JsonSerializerContext` for AOT/performance.
*   **Java (Jackson):** Configure the `ObjectMapper` instance used by the SDK (passed to Transport Providers or Builders). Register custom `Module`s, `JsonSerializer`s, `JsonDeserializer`s. Use features like `@JsonCreator`, `@JsonValue`.
*   **TypeScript (Zod/JSON):** Zod primarily focuses on validation *to/from* standard JS types. For non-standard wire formats, you'd likely perform conversion *before* Zod validation (on read) or *after* Zod creates a plain JS object (on write), before passing to `JSON.stringify`. Libraries like `superjson` could be integrated at the transport boundary.
*   **Python (Pydantic/JSON):** Use custom Pydantic types with `@validator`/`@serializer`, `RootModel`, custom JSON encoders/decoders passed to `json.dumps`/`loads`, or faster libraries like `orjson` integrated at the transport level.

### 6. Performance Tuning Transports

Beyond handler logic ([Blog 11](blog-1.md1)), transport tuning can help:

*   **Buffer Sizes:** Adjust internal buffers for streams/pipes/channels (platform/library specific) to balance memory usage and throughput.
*   **Threading/Scheduling (Java/C#):** Configure thread pools or Reactor schedulers used for I/O and handler execution. Ensure non-blocking operations don't starve CPU-bound work. Use Java's Virtual Threads for simpler scaling of blocking code.
*   **Serialization Choice:** Benchmark different JSON libraries (e.g., `System.Text.Json` source-gen vs. reflection in C#, Jackson vs. Gson vs. LoganSquare in Java, built-in vs. `orjson` in Python) if serialization is a bottleneck.
*   **Transport Protocol Choice:** For very high-frequency, low-latency needs where both ends are controllable, consider a custom binary transport (e.g., Protobuf over gRPC or WebSockets) instead of JSON-RPC over Stdio/HTTP. *This is a significant departure from standard MCP.*

### Conclusion: Power Comes with Responsibility

The MCP SDKs provide well-defined extension points, allowing advanced developers to tailor communication to specific needs by implementing custom transports or handling non-standard methods. They also offer varying degrees of flexibility for modifying core behavior and customizing serialization, leveraging the strengths of their respective platforms (DI in C#, explicit builders in Java, dynamic patching in TS/Python).

However, deviating from the standard specification, especially with custom methods or transports, inherently sacrifices interoperability. These advanced techniques should be employed judiciously, primarily for:

*   Integrating with legacy or specialized systems where standard transports aren't feasible.
*   Prototyping potential future MCP features within a controlled environment.
*   Optimizing for extreme performance requirements where standard JSON/HTTP overhead is prohibitive.

For generally useful enhancements, contributing back to the official SDKs or proposing changes to the MCP specification itself remains the preferred path to ensure a healthy, interoperable ecosystem. Understanding these extensibility points empowers developers to push MCP's boundaries while being mindful of the trade-offs involved.
